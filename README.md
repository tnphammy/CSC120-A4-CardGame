# A7 Linked Lists

Your readme should include the following information. **Each student** needs to submit all of this information, even when pair programming. 

## Submission Details

Your Name: Tammy Pham


Programming Partner Name (if you are submitting identical code): N/A


Other Collaborators (submitting related but non-identical code): N/A


Kudos/shout-out to particularly helpful members of the class or teaching staff: TA Jade Lilian


Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials: N/A


If you used AI, please describe how and the interaction between AI and your understanding of this assignment and specifically the related data structures and algorithms: I used ChatGPT to interpret the instructions for the method mouseDragged(). It helped me understanding and visualize that movingPile can be null while cardUnderMouse is not (at the beginning of the drag when the mouse is clicked). Otherwise, I did not use it at all. 

## Reflection

In what ways were the use of linked lists particularly appropriate for this assignment? 
- With a less index-focused approach, I could focus on the logic of the execution of each action (like flip until the end of the deck, etc. ). 
- Insertions and deletions are quick and pointer-based, so you didn't need to call the array's index if you wanted to delete it.


What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
- Interpreting some methods and how they were supposed to behave/handle edge cases was challenging.
- Figuring out ways to troubleshoot my methods, it felt like I wasn't able to think broadly outside of cases that were mentioned in the instructions.
- I lost track of the Pointers and Iterators sometimes when I was pseudo-coding.


What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
- I learned how to take other methods into consideration when making one method, as no method needs to do it all. Of course, it should do as much as it is still efficient, but if another method can help it and apply to other methods, make that helper method! (based on  `mouseReleased()`)
- I gained a lot more muscle memory of traversing and modifying linked lists
